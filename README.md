## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first design

### What I learned

- How to apply an overlay to an image using psuedo-elements.
- How to reposition elements responsively using Flexbox.
- How to use CSS descendant selectors.
- That the browser can scale down the viewport to fit overflowing content.

### Continued development

- I want to get better at working with images, especially when it comes to making them responsive.
- I want to improve my ability to modify the height and width of elements to achieve the desired effect.

### Notes for next time

- Look into using picture tags for images.
- Look up mix-blend-mode for adding hue to images.
- Using background images makes replacing them in media queries easier, as only the url needs to be changed.
- For contiguous content that shares a similar format (e.g. the card stats), consider using ul and li tags.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This page has nice pictures that really helps me to visualise how Flexbox works.
- [Web Dev Simplified - Learn Every CSS Selector in 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1mER1bV0N0&t=102s) - This video is a really good overview of the different types of selectors available with nice visual examples.
